/*"Concurrency is a way to structure a thing so that you can, maybe, use parallelism to do a better job. But parallelism is not the goal of concurrency; concurrency's goal is a good structure."


Instead, the idea is to move responsibility for implementing efficient parallel processing away from the developer and into the core design of the system, leaving the developer free to structure concurrency through a simple and predictable callback system, safe from deadlocks and other traps.
