/*Good morning sir.

It's my pleasure to introduce my self.My name is GuoXian. You can also call me Beaver. I’m from Jian, a city in Jiangxi province. Now I'm in Shenzhen and I like it here and want to find a suitable job for myself.

I received my master degree from South China University of Technology in 2014. 

And I have 3 years work experience.
I worked as a Senior Web frontend Engineer in CTRIP, a company of online travel agency.  My major work was to build and maintain the website of International Flight Business. During my work I introduced ReactJS to replace the old jQuery technology stack. I am good at Javascript, html and css. I also did some other things like coding Baisc React Component Library, optimizing web performance, user behavior tracking data reporting and fix online bugs and issues And I'm also a good team player.

I'm eager to learn new things such as libraries and frameworks and apply them to my work. When I got spare time I'd like to follow framework authors on Twitter to get the latest news of web development and renew my knowledge.

I am eager to get an opportunity to fully play my ability and skills. I think this job is a good choice and I can be competent for it!!.

That’s all,thank you.
